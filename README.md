# ExifToolGui
A GUI for ExifTool

This is an updated version of the ExifToolGui program created by Bogdan Hrastnik. Many thanks go out to him.

This updated source addresses the following issues.

1) Compiles with Delphi Community Edition. Without any 3rd party libraries.
2) Added styles.
3) Image preview is done with WIC. The autorotate should be available for more formats then just JPG
4) The Google Map is replaced by OSM map. The internal browser is now based on Edge, and not on IE.

 To achieve this the source had to be modified quite a lot. Dont expect a flawless product.
