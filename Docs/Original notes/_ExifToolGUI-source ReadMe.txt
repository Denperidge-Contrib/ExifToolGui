ExifToolGUI source files
============================================================
Pascal language (Embarcadero Delphi XE2)

External libraries used:
	JAM ShellBrowser v8.02
	RiverSoftAVG ChartingVCL30
	TMS ComponentPack v6.4
	RotateImage v1.54
-these are not freeware/shareware and thus not included in
this package.
All external libraries are VCL (Visual Component Library),
which serve for visual appearance only.

All procedures/functions used for communication with ExifTool
and for parsing exif data coming from ExifTool, are provided
in these source files.
-btw. I'm aware that they are poorly commented :-)

For those not familiar with Delphi Pascal: only files with
*.pas suffix might interest you.
If you don't have Delphi Pascal (you only wish to study source)
then I recommend using Notepad++ (or similar), which will show
the code nicely formatted & highlighted.

Note: This code was last used/tested on ExifTool v895.

Big thanks to author of ExifTool (Phil Harvey) for supporting
me in GUI project.
